# tinyrenderer-jnch009

During my time at university I took Introduction to Computer Graphics which we were tasked to create a Software Renderer with a minimal amount of code provided to us. Starting from line rendering, 
to polygons, to color interpolation, transformations, camera work and ending off with lighting models (Flat, Gouroud and Phong). I've been looking to revisit this work since graduating back in 2019 as
I spent countless hours working on the renderer and managed to get some parts looking great, but others looking terrible/incomplete. I stumbled upon https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer and was
pleasantly surprised that this is very similar to that course and wanted to experience it again and make it look better.

Some sample renders so far:
